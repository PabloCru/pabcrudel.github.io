    FireSpotter, hackathon winner at <abbr

    SpaceApps Valencia <time datetime="2023">2023</time>
  </h2>

  <p>
    I participated with my classmates in the NASA SpaceApp Hackathon in Valencia. We were
    there because Jorge Lopez, our teacher, encouraged us to participate not only to face
    the challenge and gain experience but also to improve our self-confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Hackathon started on <time datetime="2023-10-06T19:00"
      >Friday, October 6th, at 7:00 PM</time

    After the presentations, we began our challenge:

    <h3>Managing Fire: Increasing Community-based Fire Management Opportunities</h3>
    <p>
      NASA's satellite-derived active fire data are freely available and provide valuable
      information to a wide range of users. However, as wildfires continue to increase in
      frequency, number, and size, the need for more diverse stakeholder groups to
      understand and use these data is rapidly expanding. Your challenge is to develop
      solutions to address fire and natural resource monitoring through innovative use of
      technology and publicly available data, enabling local communities to report and
      monitor fires and/or improve current data distribution.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    We worked hard until <time datetime="2023-10-08T17:00">Sunday at 5:00 PM</time> when we
    showed our projects. Facing the challenge over the weekend was a big test for us, and we
    learned a lot about working as a real team using Git and developing an <abbr
      title="Application"
      >App
    </abbr> from scratch using vanilla <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>,
    <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr
      title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    After all the hard work and collaboration, we were thrilled to present our real app
    during the event. Despite not using the latest technologies or groundbreaking
    approaches, our app, deployed on GitHub Pages, successfully addressed the challenge
    with a minimal viable product.

    Winning the event was a fantastic surprise, and it showed us that even simple
    solutions can make a meaningful impact. This experience has fueled our enthusiasm to
    keep learning and contributing to innovative projects in the future.

    <h3>Fostering Growth: The Purpose Behind the Fork</h3>

    <p>
      Since the project's inception, my consistent commitment has been instrumental in
      refining features, addressing functionalities, and introducing enhancements to
      elevate the user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      To transparently showcase and document these contributions, I've created a personal
      fork of the main repository. This fork serves as a dedicated space to highlight my
      work, providing a platform for effective code management.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to note that, in maintaining the project's integrity, all
      enhancements are proposed through pull requests (PRs) to the main repository. While
      currently the primary contributor, my focus is on upholding code consistency and
      quality.
